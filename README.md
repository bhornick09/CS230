1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room client is a company looking to expand their android application, 'Draw It or Lose It' to further operating systems. Specifically, the Gaming Room wants a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current android game. The requirements given by The Gaming Room for the final product is:
  * A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
  * Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
  * Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
  * Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each       instance of a game, team, or player.

3. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    In developing this documentation, I feel as though I researched particulary well, filtering through many sources to get accurate ideas and dismantling bias as much as possible. For example, the pros and cons list of operating systems as well as the best choice was heavily bias in many sources so going through many was crucial to get the overall picture. 

4. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
   Working through a design document was extremely helpful in my own mental clarity during development. Without a structured approach I find my brain all over the place as I code, but the design document kept my goal focused and allowed me to be more efficient with my development.
  
5. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, it would be the design constraints because there are many more that I had not thought of. To improve it, I would add scalability because it is obvious The Gaming Room is looking to expand there company and I would also add security as a design constraint because it is a constraint and is a very important one. 

6. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  To interpret the user's needs and implement them into my software design I used a customer first approach, as there is no company without customers. Focusing on a seamless experience for the user, with the best performance even on less powerful machines, was a focus in all of the final decisions. Focusing on a user's needs is extremely important as a user is the whole force behind a business. A business cannot run without customers, and satisfied customers lead to growth.
  
7. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
   I approach designing the software with a structured approach. I knew the customer's restraints so these were implented or noted immediately. I also took the customer's opinion as a top level of importance, in the case of feedback, The feedback would be easy to address
